It's been a few years now since I had a blog, I actually can't remember how long. One thing I know though is that I have missed writing.

I don't expect a lot of people to read this blog, and the main purpose of this blog is reflection. Writing down what and how I have done things gives me the option to reflect on what I did, and maybe find improvements. It would be great if others could take advantage of what I write, so if you use anything from my blog, be sure to Tweet me ([@joachimdalen](https://twitter.com/joachimdalen)). Would love to get some feedback!

What can you expect to see here? Well, I'll most likely be blogging about what I'm doing at the given time. Here's a list of some of the possible topics:

- Azure
- Azure DevOps and DevOps in general
- Automation
- Programming (mostly in the following languages):
  - C#
  - ASP.NET Core
  - TypeScript / React
- Project setup (typical things that are nice to have in a template)

In the lack of things to say, I'll keep this post short, but I hope you stick around.
